       </head> My first piece of advice to you would be if you are going to persue a technology type job in the future i would recommend that you take a coding class in high school because then you'll get a headstart on everything your gonna need to know to be able to pursue that job.
    <body> The next piece of advice i have for you would be too if you really really want that technology pathway job 1 take a class like i said earlier and 2 begin to really study that pathway and get to know what your about to be dealing with in that situation for the benefit of your success and also your sake.
